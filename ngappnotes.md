Decorators

- objects those are used to define execution behavior of
  - class
  - property
  - method
  - event

# Syntax is @<DecoratorName>

@NgModule

- Provided by @angular/core
- applied on class to make the class as Angular Module
- Properties of NgModule
  - The 'imports', of the type array, this imports all standard Angular modules to run application
    - The "BrowserModule", from @angular/platform-browser
  - The 'exports', of the type array, this is used to export components/services/pipes/directives of the current module so that other module can import it and use it, non mandatory property
  - The 'declarations', of the type array, this is used to define "lazy loading" to all components/pipes/directives in the current application
  - The 'providers', of the type array, this is used to register all angular services and they are ready for DI
  - The "bootstrap" of the type array, this is used to deine components to be executed when app is loaded in browser

@Component

- Provided by @angular/core
- applied on class to make the class as Angular component
- Properties of Component '
  - The 'selector' --> custom defined name for component when it will be used in index.html or used as HTML element in other component
    - syntax --> app-<component-name>-component
  - The 'template' --> an inline HTML template aka HTML code for the component
  - The 'templateUrl' --> URL of external html file
  - The 'style/styleUrls' --> inline or external css files respectively

@Directive

- Provided by @angular/core
- applied on class to make the class as Angular Directive

@Pipe

- Provided by @angular/core
- applied on class to make the class as Angular Custom Pipe

@Injectable

- Provided by @angular/core
- applied on class to make the class as Angular Service

@Input --> Applied on Data member of Component/Directive to accept the input data from its parnent component/directive

- Provided by @angular/core

@Output --> Applied on an Event of Component/Directive to emit event

- Provided by @angular/core

@HostListener

- Provided by @angular/core
- Applied on method of Directive (generally) to define for which event the method will be executed

Use platformBrowserDynamic() object from @angular/platform-browser-dynamic to provide NgModule to Browser Module
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapmodule(AppModule)
============================================================================================================================================================
Angular for LOB Apps

- Frequently used Bootsrap class
- Div --> container and form-group
- input type text, select element --> form-control
- button --> btn btn-default btn-success btn-warning
- table --> table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed

* Binding
  - Expression aka Interpolation
    - Mechanism to bind member of Component to HTML element in "read-only" mode
      - Syntax --> {{<PROPERTY>}}
  - Property Binding --> []
    - Binding members of Component to an attribute of HTML element
    - One-Way from Component to UI
    - Syntax
      - <tag-name [<attaribute>]="<MEMBER-FROM-Component>">
        - [value],[disabled],[hidden],[href], [checked]
  - Event Binding -->()
    - The Event raised on UI and it executes a method from component
    - always from UI to component
    - Syntax
      - <tag-name (<EVENT>)="methodfromcomponent()">
        - (click),(keyup),(change),(mouseenter),(mouseleave), etc.
  - Two-Way Binding
    - Two-Way Binding = Property Binding + Event Binding
      - [(ngModel)]
        - ngModel, is a directive of angular that is used for two-way binding
        - ngModule must import "FormsModule" from @angular/forms to execute ngModel.
* Forms
* Services
* Directives
  - UI and Behavioral Objects
  - 3 Types of Directives
    - Component Directive
    - Structural Directive
      - Used to add/remove DOM dynamically based on DataBinding
        - \*ngFor
        - \*ngIf
        - \*ngSwitch ngSwitchCase
    - Attribute Directive
      - Attribues of HTML DOM Elements
        - ngModel
        - ngClass
* Pipes
* Routes
